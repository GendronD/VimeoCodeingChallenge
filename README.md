Coding Challenge from Vimeo

Video Playback Engineering Internship - Summer 2019
Assignment - Video Cues using Vimeo API
Author: Devin Gendron

Hi and thanks for taking the time to review my submission!
My project runs via nodejs and its dependencies are listed here:

	"express": "^4.16.4",
    "express3-handlebars": "^0.5.2",
    "handlebars": "^4.0.12"

For your convenience, I've included the installation commands:
	
	npm install express --save
	npm install express3-handlebars --save
	npm install handlebars --save

Once these are installed, simply run:

	node index.js

to test my submission!  I set the video to a favorite of mine that is 
exclusively on Vimeo. I hope you enjoy!


Note:

I had read in the README.md included in the challenge file that vanilla
JavaScript was required.  I emailed Gabriella Pfeffer back inquiring if this
included the dependencies I included, but I did not hear back.  If you would like
just an HTML file and a JS file that manipulates it, email me at gendron.devin@gmail.com
and I will happily send them!
